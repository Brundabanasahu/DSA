## About

- Solutions are added as I progress through the sheet.
- Code is kept simple and readable.
- Each problem is solved using the approach I find most suitable.
- This repository serves as a reference for revision.

## Goals

- Strengthen core DSA concepts  
- Improve logical thinking and coding ability  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Complete the Striver SDE Sheet

## Progress

Progress can be followed through commits and updates to this repository.
