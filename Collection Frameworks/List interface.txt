List interface:
~It is the child interface of collection.
~if we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are allowed and insertion order must be preserved then we should go for list.
~we can differentiate duplicates by using index.
~we can preserve insertion order by using index, hence index play very important role in the list interface.

List Method:
void add(int index,object o)
boolean addAll(int index,collection c)
object get(int index)
object remove (int index)
object set(int index ,object new)
int indexOf(object o)
int lastIndexOf(object o)
ListIterator listiterator();
