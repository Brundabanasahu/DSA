ArrayList:
~The underlined data structure resized array or growable.
~duplicates are allowed.
~insertion order is preserved.
~heterogenous objects are allowed [except treeset and treemap everywhere heterogeneous objects are allowed].
~null insertion is possible.


Constructors:
Creates an empty arraylist obkect with default initial capacity 10.once array list reaches its map capacity a new array list will be created with new capacity=(current capacity*3/2)+1. 

1.ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
2. ArrayList al=new ArrayList(int intialCapacity);
3.ArrayList al=new ArrayList(Collection c);


//Demo Program

import java.util.*;
public class ArrayListdemo {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        ArrayList l=new ArrayList<>();
        l.add("B");
        l.add("R");
        l.add(null);
        System.out.println(l);//[B,R,null]
        l.remove(2);
        System.out.println(l);//[B,R]
        l.add(2,"S");
        l.add("P");
        System.out.println(l);//[B,R,S,P]
    }
}

~usually we can use collection to hold and transfer objects from one place to another place, to provide support for this requirements every collection already implements serializable and cloneable interface.

~ArrayList and vector classes implements RandomAccess interface so that we can access any random elements with the same speed.

~hence if our frequent operation is retrieval operation then ArrayList Is the best.


RandomAccess:
~Present in java.util package.
~it doesn't contain any methods and it is Marker interface.


~Arraylist is the best choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation 
~Arraylist is the worst choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in the middle.
